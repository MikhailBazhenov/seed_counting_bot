# First create a VPS server with Ubuntu 24 OS for the bot with 20 GB disc, 1G RAM and 1 CPU core
# I usually use WinSCP to copy files to the server and PuTTY to run commands.
# On the server, create a folder called /home/seed_counting_bot and copy all the files there, including sunflower_seeds_bot.py and yolo11_seeds.pt (model weights)

# Installing virtual environment packages
apt install python3.12-venv

# Create virtual environment in the /home/venv directory
python3 -m venv /home/venv

# Activate environment
source /home/venv/bin/activate

# Install necessary libraries
pip install python-telegram-bot
pip install Pillow
pip install ultralytics
apt-get update && apt-get install libgl1

# Now we can run the bot and test it
python3 sunflower_seeds_bot.py

# If it works fine, close the connection and run it again with 'nohup'

# In a new connection we need to activate the environment
source /home/venv/bin/activate

# Switch to the bot folder
cd /home/seed_counting_bot

# Run the bot with 'nohup' so it continues to run after disconnecting from the server
nohup python3 sunflower_seeds_bot.py

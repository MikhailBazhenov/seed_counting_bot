# seed_counting_bot
Code for the Telegram bot that counts sunflower seeds using the YOLO11 fine-tuned model.
The model was trained on an original dataset:
https://universe.roboflow.com/sunflower-ukhcc/sunflower_new/

Place the achenes of sunflower on a sheet of paper, take a photo using a smartphone camera and send it to the bot. 
The bot will count the achenes and mark them with dots on the image.
It works only for black-colored sunflower achenes and can also distinguish sterile sunflower ovaries without seeds inside.
